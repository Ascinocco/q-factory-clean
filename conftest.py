# THIS LIVES IN THE ROOT CONFTEST ON PURPOSE. It was a test inside
# `tests/`, which cannot detect its own package being dropped from
# `testpaths` -- the guard goes out of scope with the thing it guards.
# Measured on main: removing `tests/` gives a GREEN suite with 143 tests
# silently not run. A suite that stops running tests and still passes is
# the most expensive kind of wrong, because nothing about the output
# distinguishes it from success.
#
# pytest loads the rootdir conftest regardless of which paths it collects,
# so a check here survives the deletion it is checking for. That is the
# whole reason it is not a test.
