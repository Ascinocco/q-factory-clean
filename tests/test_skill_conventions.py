"""Every skill's copy of the conventions must match the canonical text.

`runbooks/skill-conventions.md` is the source of truth; each SKILL.md
copies it verbatim, because a skill must be self-contained when loaded.
Copying means N copies that can drift, and these tests are what stop it.

TWO KINDS OF TEST HERE, AND BOTH ARE NECESSARY:

  * PINS prove the skills AGREE with the runbook.
  * A BEHAVIOUR test proves the text they agree ON works.

Pins alone are not enough and the failure is total: if the canonical
fence lost its empty-page guard, every pin would pass and every skill
would hang. Unanimous and wrong, with every signal green.

THE MUTATION THAT DEMONSTRATES THIS HAS TO BE THE PROPAGATED ONE.
Dropping the guard from the canonical copy *alone* turns the pins red
too -- they compare each skill against canon, so a one-sided edit is a
disagreement and they catch it. That looks reassuring and proves the
wrong thing. The dangerous edit is the CONSISTENT one: canon and every
skill changed together, which is exactly what normal propagation does.
Measured, with the guard removed from canon and both skills:

    test_the_runbook_defines_a_canonical_fence                PASSED
    test_discovery_finds_every_skill_directory                PASSED
    ...carries_the_canonical_fence[document-intake]           PASSED
    ...carries_the_canonical_fence[statement-intake]          PASSED
    test_the_canonical_fence_actually_drains                  PASSED
    test_the_canonical_fence_terminates_on_an_empty_page      FAILED

There is deliberately NO floor test ("at least N skills carry a fence")
beside the per-skill pin. A floor stops discriminating once the
population exceeds it: with three skills, one can drop its fence and
">= 2" still passes while the identity check compares the two survivors
and agrees -- every guard green, one skill silently unprotected
(impl-3 measured exactly that, 8 passed and blind). The requirement here
is per-skill, which makes a floor a weaker restatement of the same rule
and the weaker statement is the one that goes blind.

Every pin green, the behaviour test the only thing red. That divergence
is the whole argument for having both.
